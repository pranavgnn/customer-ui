## Introduction

This project implements a Customer Management System with a modern React frontend and RESTful API backend. The application enables businesses to efficiently manage customer data through an intuitive user interface, supporting operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting customer records.

The frontend is built using React with TypeScript for type safety, while the backend uses Spring Boot to provide RESTful APIs for data operations.

## System Architecture

The project follows a modern web application architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript using a component-based architecture
- **Backend**: Spring Boot REST API following MVC pattern
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern design
- **API Communication**: Fetch API for frontend-backend integration

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - React 19
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS 4
  - React Router 7
  - React Hook Form
- **Backend**:
  - Java
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring Data JPA
  - RESTful API

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend implementation follows modern React practices with a component-based architecture and TypeScript for type safety.

### Key Features

#### Component Structure

- **Page Components**: Responsible for different views (home, customer list, customer details, forms)
- **Form Components**: Multi-step form for customer information entry
- **UI Components**: Reusable components like cards, buttons, and input fields
- **Layout Components**: Structure for consistent page layout

#### State Management

- React hooks for local component state
- Context API for shared state where necessary
- Form state management using React Hook Form

#### Routing

The application uses React Router for navigation between different views:

- Home page
- Customer listing
- Customer details view
- Customer creation form
- Customer edit form

## User Interface Design

The user interface is designed with a focus on usability and aesthetics, using Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Design Principles

- Clean, minimalist interface
- Consistent color scheme and typography
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Interactive components with appropriate feedback
- Form validation with user-friendly error messages

### UI Components

- Glass-effect cards for information display
- Custom styled form inputs
- Interactive buttons with hover effects
- Responsive navigation
- Modern data tables

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs. The main endpoints used are:

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                  |
| ------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| GET    | /api/customer      | Retrieve all customers       |
| GET    | /api/customer/{id} | Retrieve a specific customer |
| POST   | /api/customer      | Create a new customer        |
| PUT    | /api/customer/{id} | Update an existing customer  |
| DELETE | /api/customer/{id} | Delete a customer            |

### Data Models

The TypeScript interfaces for data models ensure type safety when working with API data:

```typescript
export interface CustomerName {
  firstName: string;
  middleName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

export interface CustomerContactDetails {
  type: string;
  value: string;
  dialCode?: string;
}

export interface CustomerAddress {
  addressLine1: string;
  addressLine2?: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  country: string;
  zipCode: string;
}

export interface CustomerIdentityProof {
  type: string;
  value: string;
  issuedDate: string;
  expiryDate: string;
}

export interface Customer {
  id: number;
  name: CustomerName;
  dateOfBirth: string;
  contactDetails: CustomerContactDetails[];
  address: CustomerAddress;
  identityProofs: CustomerIdentityProof[];
}
```

## Testing Results

Comprehensive testing was performed to verify the functionality of all frontend features and their integration with backend APIs.

### 1. Homepage View

The application's landing page provides an overview of the system with navigation to key features.
